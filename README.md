# Stock price and chart using Meteor

This is a simple single page app to select stocks using the Yahoo Finance API. This application is based on the
tutorial by [Tim Barclay with Scott Logic](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/07/14/meteor.html).


1. [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) - Framework this application is built on.

2. [Yahoo Fianance](https://developer.yahoo.com/) - provides Stock symbols, names and historical data.

3. [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) - charting library, using the [non-commercial free license](http://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts/#non-commercial).
